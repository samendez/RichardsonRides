# Richardson Rides

Richardson Rides is a project that aims to raise awareness of public transport in the city of Richardson. This is accomplished by creating an system that rewards the user with discount prices at select stores.

# How It Works

The system relies on GPS technology. The user will get on a bus that is equipped with a GPS tracker and connect to our website on their mobile device. The user's location will then be compared to the location of the bus and after an interval, it will be compared again. If both comparisons come back true then the user is rewarded with a QR code which can be used at the selected store.

# Impact and Incentive

Our goal was to create a system that will benefit the city of Richardson in as many ways as possible. Our user-reward system has the potential to reduce traffic, help low-income citizens, raise awareness of public transport, and even reduce the carbon footprint for the city. Stores will want to be apart of this system as it will be good publicity for them as well as increase potential customers. We want to make it as easy as possible for store owners to implement our system and we will work diligently with each to ensure a smooth operation.

# Future

We strongly believe this project has a bright future in Richardson and beyond. Our system can be easily implememnted anywhere public transport is accessible. We are committed to continue devlopment of this project to prove that this concept works.

# About the Project

This project was developed by Jay Speights, Shane Mendez, and Jordan Barnfield for Richardson City Hack Week. Multiple problems were presented with the challenge of creating a solution that can be incorporated in the City of Richardson.
